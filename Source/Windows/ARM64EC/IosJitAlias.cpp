// iOS JIT-pool alias table.
//
// On iOS, ARM64EC PE images cannot run from their loaded address (iOS rejects
// mprotect(RX) on file-backed mmaps). Wine's ntdll-unix copies each PE image
// into the dual-mapped JIT pool. Code in the copied image executes from the
// alias address, not the original PE address.
//
// FEX's range trackers only know the ORIGINAL PE address ranges, so they
// report alias addresses as non-executable. The lookup wrappers in
// Module.cpp call IosJitReverseTranslate to map alias → PE-original for
// the tracker query, then IosJitTranslate to map the result back.
//
// Lives in a separate TU from Module.cpp because accessing the table's
// global storage directly from ARM64EC class methods in Module.cpp produced
// a "misaligned ldr/str offset" link error — probably an ADRP+LDR
// page-offset issue in the hybrid emit. Putting the data + accessors in
// their own TU sidesteps the issue.

 * iOS reserves the low 4GB of every task, so a PE whose preferred base is below
 * it cannot be mapped there (measured four ways -- see the ml938 block in
 * ntdll-unix/signal_arm64_ios.c). Such an image is mapped high instead, and
 * Wine's fault handler services data accesses to the vacated low range against
 * the real mapping.
 *
 * That covers faults, but not QUESTIONS. FEX's QueryGuestExecutableRange asks
 * the InvalidationTracker whether an address is executable; the tracker is
 * built from actually-mapped sections, so a low address answers "no" and FEX
 * refuses to build the entry block ("NoExec instruction in entry block"). No
 * fault occurs, so there is nothing for the handler to service. This table
 * lets that one lookup be answered.
 *
 * ⛔ DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FROM IosAliasEntries. Module.S's ExitFunctionEC
 * translates branch targets PeBase -> JitBase through that table inline, so an
 * entry there REWRITES CONTROL FLOW. Putting a sub-floor window in it would
 * silently move the guest RIP to the high backing address, which is exactly
 * what must not happen: the guest's address identity has to stay low. This
 * table is query-only and Module.S never sees it.
 *
 * Registration reuses BTCpu64IosAddAliasMapping rather than adding an export,
 * because a new export would need a PE-side binding and these are ARM64EC PE
 * entry points -- NOT callable from native Mach-O code (ml613 armed such a
 * call and crashed every launch). The discriminator is self-identifying and
 * disjoint: a real JIT alias's PeBase is a mapped PE image base, which on iOS
 * is always >= 4GB; a sub-floor window's low base is by definition < 4GB.
