/* MADEIRA ml1430: WOW64 SYSCALL PARKING FOR THE CODE-BUFFER SWEEPER.
 *
 * The emitted code of every process shares one code buffer that is replaced by a new
 * generation when it fills; an old generation is freed only when no thread references it.
 * The ml460 sweeper moves parked threads to the newest generation, but only the ARM64EC
 * frontend ever registered threads with it: there, a syscall leaves emitted code
 * (InSimulation=0). Here a syscall is a call OUT of an emitted block (BranchOps.cpp
 * DEF_OP(Syscall)), so a thread waiting in a syscall has a return address into its
 * generation on the stack and could never be moved. Device log: a desktop client's
 * 32-bit browser processes (hundreds of mostly waiting threads) kept 30 generations live,
 * 720 MB of the 896 MB pool, until code allocation failed and a thread died at the
 * out-of-pool fault.
 *
 * What the block does after the handler returns is fixed for these syscalls: the bridge
 * instructions end their block, and the tail spills nothing new: it restores SP, refills
 * every static register, clears InSyscallInfo, pops the dynamic registers and exits to the
 * dispatcher at the RIP the handler wrote (OpcodeDispatcher.cpp SyscallOp, OS_GENERIC:
 * no result register). The dispatcher's LoopTopFillSRA entry does exactly that from the
 * dispatcher's own stack pointer. So a thread that is moved while blocked resumes there
 * instead of in its old block, and its old generation can go.
 *
 * Only the outermost syscall of a simulation is ever parked: a callback that re-enters
 * simulation from inside a syscall sets IosInSim=1 again (BTCpuSimulateImpl), and nested
 * syscalls are never parked, so no emitted frame other than the one being redirected can
 * be below a moved thread. MADEIRA_WOW_SYSCALL_SWEEP=0 disables all of it. */

/* MADEIRA: the CPU area is the 32-bit register state other threads see and set.
 *
 * Wine keeps a WOW64_CPURESERVED header ({ USHORT Flags; USHORT Machine; }) at
 * TEB64->TlsSlots[WOW64_TLS_CPURESERVED], followed by the I386_CONTEXT that
 * RtlWow64GetCurrentCpuArea() returns. A GetThreadContext from another thread
 * reads that context, and a SetThreadContext from another thread writes it and
 * sets WOW64_CPURESERVED_FLAG_RESET_STATE (ntdll's set_thread_wow64_context,
 * and the iOS wineserver's apply-on-resume path, which writes it while the
 * target is held inside a system call). wow64cpu, the reference CPU module,
 * stores its registers into the CPU area on every transition out of 32-bit
 * code and reloads them when it finds RESET_STATE on the way back.
 *
 * This module only did the equivalent through WOW_CPU_AREA_DIRTY, which is set
 * by BTCpuSuspendLocalThread. The Wine tree this host uses never calls that
 * (wow64's NtSuspendThread thunk is a plain NtSuspendThread and
 * Wow64SuspendLocalThread is a stub), so a cross-thread Get saw whatever the
 * CPU area held since the last BTCpuGetContext/SetContext, and a cross-thread
 * Set was never loaded. So, as wow64cpu does:
 *   - FlushCpuAreaForExit() stores the JIT state into the CPU area before a
 *     system call or unix call leaves emitted code;
 *   - LockJITContext() consumes RESET_STATE on the thread's own CPU area and
 *     reloads the JIT state from it, exactly as for WOW_CPU_AREA_DIRTY.
 * Both only touch the calling thread's own TEB. */

   *   allocate_virtual_memory (virtual_ios.c:14467) translates the sub-4GiB zero_bits ceiling into

   *   mprotect_exec finds that iOS/TXM will not grant exec (:8301-8318: it mprotects, re-queries
   *   via mach_vm_region and sees no VM_PROT_EXECUTE), runs a 64 MB BACKWARD MZ SCAN through guest
   *   memory looking for an owning PE image (:8417), decides the page is anonymous RWX (:8470),

   *   vm_protect()s it R+X (:8715) - i.e. read-execute, NOT writable.
   *
   * So the old request did not fail; it succeeded in the worst possible way. The page stayed
   * inside the window (so the window check below still passed) but its backing became
   * pool-remapped R+X memory - executable memory inside the guest window, which invariant 7

   * Executability is FEX's own bookkeeping, not the host page protection: the

 * MADEIRA ml970: SELF IS NOT A HANDLE OPERATION.
 *
 * [srv-stats] on a 32-bit D3D9 title showed five wineserver request kinds
 * locked together at ~177/s each -- get_object_info=1770 dup_handle=1770
 * close_handle=1772 get_thread_context=1770 per 10 s, plus
 * set_thread_context=2950 -- which is 3 to 5 requests per rendered frame for
 * something no D3D9 game does. They are all ours: with G calls of
 * BTCpuGetContext and S of BTCpuSetContext the bodies below issue exactly
 * G+S object-info, G+S dup, G+S close, G+S get_thread_context and G+2S
 * set_thread_context requests, and G=590 S=1180 reproduces all five measured
 * numbers exactly.
 *
 * And the handle is always the same one. Every internal caller in
 * wine/dlls/wow64/syscall.c -- 32-bit exception dispatch, NtContinue,
 * NtSetContextThread, the APC and callback paths -- passes
 * GetCurrentThread(), i.e. the pseudo-handle, never a real thread handle:
 *
 *     pBTCpuGetContext( GetCurrentThread(), GetCurrentProcess(), NULL, &ctx );
 *
 * so the NtQueryObject / NtDuplicateObject / NtClose triple validates,
 * duplicates and closes a handle to the calling thread itself, three server
 * round trips to learn something the thread already knows. Worse, the
 * duplicate is what made the rest expensive: Wine's get_thread_wow64_context()
 * and set_thread_wow64_context() (dlls/ntdll/unix/signal_arm64.c) both open
 * with `BOOL self = (handle == GetCurrentThread());' and read or write the
 * caller's own CPU area with NO server call when that holds -- a duplicated
 * handle to the same thread does not compare equal, so every context transfer
 * took the cross-thread path through the server for nothing.
 *
 * So: when the target IS the current thread, skip the validation (a thread
 * always has full access to itself), skip the duplicate, and hand the
 * pseudo-handle straight down. Nothing else changes: a real handle -- which is
 * what a guest-issued GetThreadContext on another thread arrives as -- still
 * takes the original path, access check included.
 *
 * Expected: get_object_info, dup_handle and close_handle drop to ~0,
 * get_thread_info loses ~1770 per 10 s, and get_thread_context /
 * set_thread_context drop to ~0 as well because the self fast path above then
 * engages -- together ~1180 requests/s of the measured ~3700/s.
