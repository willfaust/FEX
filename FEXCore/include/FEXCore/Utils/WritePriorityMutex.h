// A custom mutex that prioritizes exclusive locks.
// In highly contested scenarios, this can help minimize overall contention time.
//
// Features:
//  - Up to 32767 pending exclusive locks ("writers")
//  - Up to 32767 pending shared_locks ("readers")
//  - Low-overhead waiting via WFE with a fallback to futex on timeout
//  - Direct writer->reader hand-off and vice-versa to further reduce overhead
//
// Trade-offs:
//  - No guaranteed order of wake-ups besides prioritizing writers
//  - No support for recursive locking
//  - We can't use FUTEX_LOCK_PI to enable priority inheritance
